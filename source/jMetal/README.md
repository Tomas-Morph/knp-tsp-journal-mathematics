# jMetal 5 Development Site

## Purpose

**jMetal** is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics.
The Web page of the project is: [http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/](http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/).
Former jMetal versions can be found in [SourceForge](http://jmetal.sourceforge.net). The current version is jMetal 5.7. 

## How to use

You can find the last released versions of jMetal on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.uma.jmetal).

To use jMetal in your project, you need at least the `jmetal-core` artifact.
It provides various components used to implement jMetal algorithms.
To implement your own, you only need this package.

jMetal comes with various algorithms already implemented, which you can obtain by adding the `jmetal-algorithm` artifact.
If you are more interested in experimenting with your own algorithms, you can instead add the `jmetal-problem` artifact to obtain various problems to solve.
You can of course add both of them to try combinations.
If you want to go further by running and evaluating different combinations, you can finally add the `jmetal-exec` artifact, which comes with various utilities.

## Status

The jMetal development version is hosted in this repository; this way, interested users can take a look to the new incoming features in advance.

If you are interested in contributing with your ideas and comments, please take a look at the current discussions in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/issues).

## Changelog of the next incoming release (jMetal 5.8)

### Algorithms

* Add class [`GMOCellRunner`](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-exec/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/runner/multiobjective/GMOCellRunner.java). This class shows how MOCell can be configured to select a priori a region of the Pareto
accorring by indicating a reference point.

### Features

* New implementation of the WFG hypervolume. Contribution of Alejandro Santiago.

### Bugs

* Fixed a bug in class `ComputeQualityIndicators`
* Fixed a bug in class `ExtendedPseudoRandomgGenerator` (issue #312)
* Fixed a bug in algorithm PESA2
* Fixed a bug in class `DefaultIntegerDoubleSolution` (issue #336)
